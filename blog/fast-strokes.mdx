### FAST
**FAST** is a quite easy system for recognition of strokes. It's an acronym for:
* **F**ace: Can the person in question still smile? If you notice that their smile is asymmetrical (one side dropping) or generally off, it might be a sign.
* **A**rms: Can the person lift both arms up and then turn the palms facing up? If they have trouble with this (can't hold the arm straight, general trouble even lifting it), it might be yet another sign.
* **S**peech: If the person is speaking unclearly, or even slurring, this could be yet another sign.
* **T**ime: Arguably the most important one, if you have a slight hunch the person is having a stroke, call 112 (or 991) immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.
